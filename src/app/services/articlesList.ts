    text: `What is Angular internationalization?

Angular internationalization refers to the act of preparing your angular app for localization, and this could be separating strings from code, enabling comments for translators, etc.

There are a few different ways to approach Angular internationalization. But in this guide, we are going to be looking at how you can do it with Transifex Native, as we can use it to automate a big part of the process.

What Is Angular Internationalization?
Angular internationalization (i18n) is how you prepare your Angular application to adapt and support multiple languages without interrupting its interface. It’s all about preparing the parts of the application that need to be translated, such as text and images, and creating a structure and syntax that can handle the translated content.

Now before we get into the details, let’s quickly understand what software internationalization means.

Internationationalization Vs Localization
Internationalization also referred to as i18n, is the process of designing and developing a software application or website so that it can easily adapt to different languages and locales. Localization (l10n), on the other hand, is the process of adapting an internationalized application for a specific language and region. This includes feeding the necessary resources to your application for different markets once it’s internationalized.

Simply put, internationalization makes your application ready for localization. So, it’s a good idea to internationalize your app before you start working on translations.

    text: `In this article I’ll teach you how to use CSS Grid to create a super cool image grid which varies the amount of columns with the width of the screen.

And the most beautiful part: the responsiveness will be added with a single line of CSS.

This means we don’t have to clutter up the HTML with ugly class names (i.e. col-sm-4, col-md-8) or create media queries for every single screen size.

Now let’s jump into it!

The setup
For this article, we’ll continue on with the grid we used in my first CSS Grid article.

Then we’ll add the images at the end of the article. Here’s how our initial grid looks:`,

Story time. Grab some chips, this post is going to make you hungry.

I ran across Codepen while exploring interesting animations. Seeing many visually beautiful pens made me want to create something beautiful too.

I looked into how some developers were drawing cool, complex shapes with canvas. I decided to give canvas a try too. I was struggling with canvas, because it depended heavily on math and JavaScript. I wanted to focus on the visuals more so than a math intensive medium. No-go to canvas (at least for now).

Then there was the Codevember challenge, where you practiced coding something everyday in November. Day 1 and Day 2 was rough because I was still learning how to navigate through all the resources available online.

On Day 3, I decided to draw a full screen Pikachu face. Pokemon GO was still a thing at the time and I absolutely adore Pikachu. Annnd also because it was super simple and made up of only circles and CSS border-radius. I added some HTML5 audio element to it, to make it even cuter. I was really happy about the outcome. This was what motivated me to continue working harder to learn more about CSS.`,

    text: `Hi, it’s Takuya. I use Neovim to develop my app called Inkdrop. Recently, I’ve got some updates for my Neovim setup since I’ve published last year. Neovim 0.5, which is nightly at the moment, comes with cool new improvements like Lua remote plugin host, built-in LSP client (yes!), and Treesitter syntax engine. I found there are already a bunch of great plugins that leverage those new nightly features. I tried them, and already love them! Besides, it works pretty well on my M1 MacBook Air, which is awesome. I’d like to introduce my latest setup with Neovim 0.5 and modern plugins. Here is a quick summary of my set up:

vim-plug — A minimalist Vim plugin manager
nvim-lspconfig — A collection of configurations for Neovim’s built-in LSP
nvim-treesitter — Treesitter configurations and abstraction layer for Neovim
completion-nvim — An auto completion framework based on Neovim’s built-in LSP
glepnir/lspsaga.nvim — A light-weight LSP plugin based on Neovim built-in LSP with highly a performant UI
telescope.nvim — A highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists
lualine.nvim — A blazing fast and easy to configure neovim statusline plugin written in pure lua
And here is my dotfiles repository:`,
